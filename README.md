# Spotify API + Analysis
Spotify is the most popular global audio streaming service with 365m users, including 165m subscribers across 178 markets. They are the largest driver of revenue to the music business today.

## Objective 
This project contains two main objectives: 
1) Extract Spotify API from webscraping Billboard's 'Hot 100' list. 
2) Analyze the Spotify music data to gain insights into user preferences, popular genres, and the popularity of different artists.
Specific Questions I wanted to answer include: 
    - Top 25 tracks based on given features? (popularity and danceability were the ones I was most intrigued by)
    - Top artists based on popularity?
    - Correlation between:
        - Danceability score and Popularity score?
        - Energy score and Danceability score?
        - Energy score and Loudness score?
        - Most popular Genres?

## Data 
The dataset contains audio statistics of the top 2000 tracks on Spotify from 2000-2019. The data contains about 18 columns each describing the track and it's qualities.
