# Spotify API + Analysis
## Objective 
The project aims to analyze the Spotify music data to gain insights into user preferences, popular genres, and the popularity of different artists.
Specific Questions I wanted to answer include: 
- Top 25 tracks based on given features? (popularity and danceability were the ones I was most intrigued by)
- Top artists based on popularity?
- Correlation between:
    - Danceability score and Popularity score?
    - Energy score and Danceability score?
    - Energy score and Loudness score?
    - Most popular Genres?
